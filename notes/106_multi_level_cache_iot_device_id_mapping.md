# Multi-Level Cache Strategy for IoT Device ID Mapping

This is a classic "multi-level cache" or "cache warming" architecture. Here’s the ideal flow for your IoT device mapping scenario:

## **Best-Practice Flow:**

1. **Source of Truth:**
    
    - **Database** is the authoritative source (true mapping, never lost).
        
    - You update the DB when devices/assets/orgs are changed in your system (admin panel, etc).
        
2. **High-Speed Shared Cache:**
    
    - **Redis** acts as a shared, fast-access cache for all services/microservices.
        
    - On device/asset/org change in DB, you _update Redis_ as well (either immediately, or via a scheduled job).
        
3. **Ultra-Fast Local Cache:**
    
    - **Go map (in-memory)** in your parser/microservice is refreshed from Redis **every few seconds** (or minutes, depending on your needs).
        
    - All per-packet lookups are done in the in-memory map for nanosecond access.

## **Typical Timing Pattern:**

|Layer|Refresh interval|Used for|
|---|---|---|
|Go map|every 5–10 sec|Per-packet lookups|
|Redis|every 1–10 min|Cross-service sync|
|DB|on change (or minutely)|Source of truth|

---

## **How It Works:**

- **Startup:**
    
    - Service loads mappings from Redis into a Go map.
        
- **Every few seconds:**
    
    - Go service refreshes Go map from Redis.
        
- **Every few minutes:**
    
    - Some backend service syncs Redis from DB (or when DB changes, update Redis instantly).
        
- **Device lookup:**
    
    - Always in Go map (fastest).
        
    - If a device is missing (should rarely happen), optionally do a Redis lookup as fallback.

## **Why is this so effective?**

- **You get the best performance (Go map)** with good consistency (thanks to Redis refresh).
    
- **Resilience:**
    
    - If you ever restart your Go service, it can reload from Redis (no downtime).
        
    - If Redis restarts, it can reload from DB.
        
- **Scalability:**
    
    - You can scale out to multiple parser nodes—all refresh from the same Redis cache.

## **Sample Data Flow Table**

|When|Go Map|Redis|Database|
|---|---|---|---|
|On device event|Lookup (ns)|—|—|
|Every 5–10 sec|Refresh map|—|—|
|Every 1–10 min|—|Refresh from DB|—|
|Device updated|—|Update Redis|Update DB|

---

## **TL;DR:**

- **YES:**
    
    - Go map (in-memory): for each packet, refreshed from Redis every few sec.
        
    - Redis: shared cache, refreshed from DB every few min or on data change.
        
    - Database: source of truth, updated by your admin/UI/backend.
