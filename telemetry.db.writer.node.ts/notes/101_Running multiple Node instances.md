## ‚úÖ **Option 1: Run multiple separate instances with different queues or routing keys**

You can simply run the same consumer multiple times **with different env variables**, like:

```bash
CONSUMER_NAME=worker1 npm run dev
CONSUMER_NAME=worker2 npm run dev

```

Then in your code, you can use that to subscribe to different queues or log which worker is running.

Update `package.json` using `concurrently`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev concurrently

```

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev:1\" \"npm run dev:2\"",
  "dev:1": "CONSUMER_NAME=worker1 nodemon dist/server.js",
  "dev:2": "CONSUMER_NAME=worker2 nodemon dist/server.js"
}

```

## ‚úÖ **Option 2: Run multiple consumers (with same logic) to improve throughput (like cluster)**

In RabbitMQ, **multiple consumers** on the **same queue** will automatically load-balance the messages between them ‚Äî so you can run 2‚Äì4 instances and RabbitMQ will distribute messages across them.

Example with `concurrently`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "concurrently \"nodemon dist/server.js\" \"nodemon dist/server.js\" \"nodemon dist/server.js\""
}
```

> This is fine for dev. In prod, you‚Äôd probably use **PM2** or Docker replicas.

---

## ‚úÖ **Option 3: Use PM2 for clustering (in dev or prod)**

Install PM2:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

Then run multiple instances:

```bash
pm2 start dist/server.js -i 3 --name consumer
```

This launches 3 instances in cluster mode (even for non-HTTP apps).

## ‚ùóÔ∏è Important Consideration

If your app is doing non-idempotent operations (e.g., writing to DB), make sure:

- **Each message is acknowledged properly**
    
- **You use durable queues**
    
- **You handle duplicate processing safely**, especially with multiple consumers

## üü¶ Summary

|Goal|How|
|---|---|
|Run same consumer multiple times for load|Use `concurrently` or `pm2`|
|Run different consumers (different logic)|Run separate scripts with different env vars|
|Production-level clustering|Use PM2 or Docker with scaling|

Let me know if you want to use PM2, Docker, or just stick with `concurrently` and I‚Äôll help you write the full setup.
